# Website-ecommerce
This project was developed to a fictional ecommerce store
following 10 SQL Joins statements proposed by my Database Subject in Univap.
  To achieve the result, I had to use technologies like:
    - Python
      - Flask framework
        - Html
        - CSS
        - JavaScript
      -MySQL
  And concepts like:
    - API REST
    - Database Normalization
