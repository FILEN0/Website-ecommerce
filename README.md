# Website-ecommerce
This project was developed to a fictional ecommerce store
following 10 SQL Joins statements proposed by my Database Subject in Univap.
  To achieve the result, I had to use technologies like:
    - <b>Python</b><br>
      - <b>Flask framework</b><br>
        - <b>Html</b><br>
        - <b>CSS</b><br>
        - <b>JavaScript</b><br>
      - <b>MySQL</b><br>
  And concepts like:<br>
    - <b>API REST</b><br>
    - <b>Database Normalization</b><br>
